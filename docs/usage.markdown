# 1. Starting MyoFInDer

There are **two possible ways to start MyoFInDer**, depending if the 
application was installed using the Windows installer or not. This section
re-uses names introduced on the [Installation page](installation.markdown), so 
it is advised to first read the Installation page before this one.

## 1.1 Using the shortcuts (Windows installer only)

The first and most straightforward way to start MyoFInDer is to **click on the 
Menu-bar or Desktop shortcuts** that were created when running the Windows 
installer. It can also be started by searching for "MyoFInDer" in the 
Menu-bar, or by any other standard way offered by Windows for opening 
applications.

## 1.2 From the command line

*In this section, replace* `python` *with* `python3` *or* `python3.x` 
*(7<=x<=10) if necessary.*

> The commands below are intended for experimented users who know what they're
> doing ! Do not try to run them unless you understand what they do ! If you 
> face any problem with starting MyoFInDer and don't know what to do, please 
> refer to the [Troubleshooting page](troubleshooting.markdown) or get in touch 
> with the maintainer.

### 1.2.1 After manual installation

No matter which installation method you chose, **it is always possible to start
MyoFInDer from the command-line**. This operation is however a bit more complex 
if you used the Windows installer, so this specific case is covered separately 
in the [next subsection](#122-after-installation-using-the-windows-installer).

If you installed MyoFInDer in a virtual environment, you should first 
**activate it** :

```console
C:\Users\User><Path to your venv>\Scripts\activate.bat
(venv) C:\Users\User>
```

With `<Path to your venv>` the path to the virtual environment you created. 
Or in Linux :

```console
user@machine:~$ source <Path to your venv>/bin/activate
(venv) user@machine:~$ â–ˆ
```

Then, you can simply **start MyoFInDer** by running the following line (ignore 
the `venv` part if not running in a virtual environment) :

```console
(venv) C:\Users\User>python -m myofinder
```

Or in Linux :

```console
(venv) user@machine:~$ python -m myofinder
```

### 1.2.2 After installation using the Windows installer

Starting MyoFInDer from the command-line might be your only option if for 
some reason **you cannot start it using the shortcuts** created by the 
installer (in which case you should report that as a bug). When run, the 
installer deploys a virtual environment at 
`C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Local\MyoFInDer\venv`, where `<User>` is your 
username on the computer. First, **activate this virtual environment** by 
running :

```console
C:\Users\User>C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\MyoFInDer\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
(venv) C:\Users\User>
```

Then, you can **start MyoFInDer** the same way as described in the previous 
subsection :

```console
(venv) C:\Users\User>python -m myofinder
```

## 1.3 Startup window and console

Once MyoFInDer is running, **a console should first appear** with log 
messages displaying in it. If started from the command-line, this console is 
already open and is the one you typed your commands in. This console simply 
displays the log messages, which may be useful for tracking errors. **The first
time you start MyoFInDer, many messages will be prompted in the console !** 
That is because MyoFInDer needs to finish its installation, and will download
a number of dependencies. This step can take up to several minutes, depending
on the speed of your internet connection and on the performance of your 
computer. The displayed messages should look similar to:

<img src="./pip_install.png" width="1000" title="Installation in console">

Shortly after the console, **a Splash window should also appear** while the 
module is loading. It can take up to 30s for the application to open, and even 
more on the first run as it has to download some data. The Splash window should 
look as such :

<img src="./usage_images/splash.png" width="300" title="Splash window">

# 2. Basic usage

## 2.1 Loading images

The first step for processing images is to **load them in the interface**. To 
do so, click on the *Load Images* button located at the top-right of the 
interface.

<img src="./usage_images/load_images.png" title="Load Images button">

**A file explorer then appears**, in which you can browse the files in your 
computer and in the network drives. In this explorer, select one or several 
images to import and click on *Open*.

<img src="./usage_images/loading_window.png" title="Load Images popup window">

Information on the imported images is then displayed in **the information 
frame** on the right of the interface. In the main frame, **the currently 
selected image is displayed**. You can select another image by left-clicking on 
it in the information frame. 

<img src="./usage_images/loaded_images.png" 
title="Display after loading images">

It is also possible to **delete a loaded image** by clicking on the *X* Delete 
button at the top-right of its information display. You will be asked to 
confirm your choice in a popup window.

<img src="./usage_images/delete_warning.png" title="Delete image popup window">

**The checkboxes of the images** allow to apply the Delete and Process 
operations to only part of the loaded images. The deletion of all the checked 
images is achieved by using the master Delete button. The master checkbox 
allows to (un)select all the images at once.

<img src="./usage_images/checkboxes.png" title="Information frame checkboxes">

## 2.2 Tuning the settings

Before processing the loaded images, you might want to **adjust the processing
parameters**. This can be done by clicking on the Settings button, that opens a
new window containing the Settings menu.

<img src="./usage_images/settings_button.png" title="Settings button">

In this menu, you can adjust various parameters like the channels to use for
the fibers and nuclei or thresholds to use when processing images. **The 
settings are applied as soon as you modify them**, there is no need to validate 
your choice. Just close this window when you're done.

<img src="./usage_images/settings_menu.png" title="Settings menu window">

The available settings are:

 * **Nuclei Channel**: The color channel of the image carrying the signal for 
   the nuclei. Default to Blue.
 * **Fiber Channel**: The color channel of the image carrying the signal for 
   the fibers. Default to Green.
 * **Save Images with Overlay**: When saving a project, the raw images are
   always saved. In addition, it is possible to save the images with the
   detected nuclei and fibers drawn on top as an overlay, if this option is set
   to On. Defaults to Off.
 * **Minimum fiber intensity**: For each channel, the color intensity of each 
   pixel is represented by a value between 0 and 255. Pixels of the Fiber
   Channel whose intensity is lower than the value of this setting are not 
   considered as part of the detected fibers. Defaults to 25.
 * **Maximum fiber intensity**: For each channel, the color intensity of each 
   pixel is represented by a value between 0 and 255. Pixels of the Fiber
   Channel whose intensity is greater than the value of this setting are not 
   considered as part of the detected fibers. Defaults to 255.
 * **Minimum nucleus intensity**: For each channel, the color intensity of each 
   pixel is represented by a value between 0 and 255. Only nuclei whose average
   intensity is greater than the value of this setting will be detected.
   Defaults to 25.
 * **Maximum nucleus intensity**: For each channel, the color intensity of each 
   pixel is represented by a value between 0 and 255. Only nuclei whose average
   intensity is lower than the value of this setting will be detected. Defaults
   to 255.
 * **Minimum nucleus diameter (px)**: The minimum "average" diameter a nucleus
   must have in order to be detected, in pixels. More precisely, the area of
   detected nuclei must be superior or equal to the area of a circle whose
   diameter is the value of this setting. Defaults to 20.
 * **Minimum nuclei count**: If a fiber does not contain at least this number 
   of nuclei, then all its positive nuclei will be counted as negative. This 
   prevents nuclei in unfused myoblasts to be counted as positive for the 
   fusion index calculation. Defaults to 3.

## 2.3 Starting a computation

Once you have adjusted the computation parameters, it is time to **start 
processing images**. To do so, simply click on the *Process Images* button.

> If you use images from a network drive, is advised to first save the project
> locally before processing them. This way, MyoFInDer won't be affected by 
> potential network issues.

<img src="./usage_images/process_images.png" title="Process Images button">

All the checked images then start being processed, and a message displays the
progress status. The images are processed one by one, in the same order as they
appear in the information frame.

<img src="./usage_images/processing_message.png" 
title="Processing progress message">

On each processed image **the nuclei and fibers are detected**, and the 
information on the right frame is updated accordingly. 

<img src="./usage_images/processed.png" 
title="Display after processing images">

The display for the selected image in the main frame might also be updated, 
depending on the selected display options. **The positive and negative nuclei 
are displayed** in different colors, and these color vary depending on the 
channels carrying the nuclei and fiber information.

It is possible to **stop the computation** while it is running by clicking on 
the *Stop Processing* button. It might take a few seconds for the computation 
to effectively stop.

<img src="./usage_images/stop_processing.png" title="Stop Processing button">

## 2.4 Adjusting the display

At the top-right of the interface, several checkboxes allow to **tune the 
display of the currently selected image** in the main frame. It is possible to 
choose which channels are displayed, and if the nuclei and fibers overlay are 
added.

<img src="./usage_images/checkboxes_display.png" 
title="Display tuning checkboxes">

Using the mouse scroll wheel, **you can zoom in and out** on the displayed 
image. The *-*, *_*, *+* and *=* keys also allow zooming in and out. Click on 
the mouse wheel and drag to **move the view** on a zoomed image.

## 2.5 Manually correcting the output

Once the images have been processed, you can **manually correct the output** by 
adding, inverting or deleting nuclei. To do so, the nuclei overlay must be 
enabled. To **add a nucleus**, left-click on an area where no nucleus is 
present. To **invert a nucleus**, i.e. switch it from positive to negative or 
vice-versa, left-click on an already existing one. And to **delete a nucleus**, 
right-click on an already existing one.

It is also possible to **invert or delete multiple nuclei at once**. To do so,
left- or right-click and drag to form a selection box. All the nuclei inside
the selection box are inverted or deleted, depending on the side of the click.

<img src="./usage_images/selection_box.png" title="Mouse selection box">

# 3. Managing your projects

## 3.1 Saving your data into a project

In MyoFInDer the **data is saved as a project**, which means that the data for 
all the loaded images is saved at once. To save a project, simply click on the 
*Save As* button at the top-right of the interface. Alternatively, you can also 
click on the *Save Project As* button in the *File* menu.

<img src="./usage_images/save_as.png" title="Save As buttons">

A file explorer then appears, in which you have to **specify the folder in 
which to save the project**. First, place the file explorer in the parent 
folder that will contain your project folder. Then, enter the desired name for 
the project folder in the *File name* field of the explorer, and validate using 
the *Save* button. Projects can only be saved in new folders, not in existing 
ones.

<img src="./usage_images/saving_popup.png" title="Save popup window">

If you look inside a saved project folder, you will find first an Excel file
containing a **summary of the detected nuclei and fibers** for each image in 
the project. Then, a `settings.pickle` file contains the setting values at the 
moment when the project was saved. The `data.pickle` files contains the 
location and nature of all the detected nuclei and fibers. The original images
are copied and saved to the `Original Images` folder. Optionally, if the *Save 
Images with Overlay* setting is enabled, an `Overlay Images` folder contains 
the images with an overlay showing the detected fibers and nuclei.

<img src="./usage_images/project_content.png" title="Project folder content">

> The `.pickle` files are binary files that are not directly readable.

## 3.2 Loading data from an existing project

To **load data from an existing project**, first click on the *Load From 
Explorer* button in the *File* menu.

<img src="./usage_images/load_project.png" title="Load From Explorer button">

A file explorer then appears, in which you have to **select the project folder 
to load**. It is not sufficient to simply have the name of the folder 
highlighted, you need to double-click on it to place the explorer inside the 
folder to open. Once you are inside the project to open, validate your choice 
using the *Ok* button.

<img src="./usage_images/loading_popup.png" title="Load Project popup window">

After loading the project, all the images it contains should be listed in the
information frame and the detected nuclei and fibers should also appear in the
nuclei and fiber overlays. 

## 3.3 Operations on saved projects

The saved projects can be located anywhere on the computer, preferably in 
folders where MyoFInDer has read and write access. Because they contain all the 
information needed to reconstruct a project, **the project folders can be
renamed or moved**, including to a different computer. They can also be 
compressed for sharing. **The project folders can be safely deleted**, with no
impact on the behavior of MyoFInDer.

# 4. Advanced usage

## 4.1 Command-line options

Two command-line options are available when starting MyoFInDer from the
console. 

The first one allows to **disable logging**, by adding the `-n` or 
`--nolog` option. It disables both the display of log messages in the console, 
and recording of the log messages to the log file. 

The second option is for **testing only**. It will initialize the interface in 
a normal way, but close it right away. This behavior is enabled by passing the 
`-t` or `--test` option.

The third command-line option, added in version `1.0.8`, is the `-f` or 
`--app-folder` option. It allows to specify the path to the directory where to 
read and store the application files, such as the log file or settings file.

## 4.2 Retrieving the log messages

The log messages are, if possible, recorded to an application folder whose 
location depends on the OS. On Linux and macOS, the application folder is 
located in `/home/<user>/.MyoFInDer`. On Windows, the application folder
is located in `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\MyoFInDer`. This application 
folder normally contains the log messages for the last run of the application, 
as well as a `settings.pickle` file containing the last used settings.
